"\3\Data for 1986-87 and later years reflect a basis of 20 meals per week, while data for earlier years are for meals served 7 days a week (the number of meals per day was not specified). Because of this revision in data collection and tabulation procedures, data are not entirely comparable with figures for previous years. In particular, data on board rates are somewhat higher than in earlier years because they reflect the basis of 20 meals per week rather than meals served 7 days a week. Since many institutions serve fewer than 3 meals each day, the 1986-87 and later data reflect a more accurate accounting of total board costs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NOTE: Data in this table represent the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data are for the entire academic year and are average charges for full-time students. Tuition and fees were weighted by the number of full-time-equivalent undergraduates, but were not adjusted to reflect student residency. Room and board are based on full-time students. Data through 1995-96 are for institutions of higher education, while later data are for degree-granting institutions. Degree-granting institutions grant associate’s or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. The degree-granting classification is very similar to the earlier higher education classification, but it includes more 2-year colleges and excludes a few higher education institutions that did not grant degrees. Student charges data for 2019-20 were collected prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and therefore do not reflect any adjustments institutions might have made later in the academic year due to the pandemic. Some data have been revised from previously published figures. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
