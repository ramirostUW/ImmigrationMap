# Project Idea and User Research
Immigrants today feel like they need to be more knowledgable to transition successful into a new country, as "dissimilarities in culture, language, and social axioms [cause] immigrants [to feel like they] need a lot of information to understand and overcome these differences. The satisfaction of these information needs helps the immigrant to adapt to their new life and society" (Wang et al., 4). Immigrants need more information that can help them understand a country before moving to them; for example, "housing is the most urgent information need after immigrants enter a new society. When considering housing problems, immigrants who are parents also need to consider their children's educational issues, and education problems also overlap with language solutions. At the same time, when looking for housing information, there will be information misunderstandings due to language problems. The more information they can obtain in one category, the more smoothly will the immigrant be able to solve some related problems" (Wang et. al, 4). There is a lack of a source of centralized, and useful information about immigration on the internet today; this lack of information also hampers the quality of decisions prospective immigrants take in regards with their destinations. In some cases, immigrants are not aware of the various factors to consider before immigrating. In other cases, immigrants might find it tough to scour the web for the information they need, even if they find it, its authenticity could be an issue.

Historically, 79.5 million people were displaced at the end of migrate out of necessity and are forcibly displaced people worldwide," (U.N) meaning that the immigrants with even fewer alternative choices of living require even more attention and assistance to help them make the best decisions for themselves and their families. Based on future trends, "immigration rates will continue to increase over time. A 2012 Gallup survey determined that nearly 640 million adults would want to immigrate if they had the chance to" (Boundless). If an informational resource was available to prospective immigrants, more adults may be more encouraged to migrate and the transition of moving might be easier.

Immigrants' wellbeing are impacted in all facets of their life as they attempt to reach their destination; in these travels, "they often face difficulties in accessing health care, housing, education or employment. They may become easy targets for abuse, extortion and exploitation due to a lack of a protective family network, a lack of information or missing documents. Many suffer accidents or illness and cannot benefit from medical care. Some lose contact with their families" (International Committee of the Red Cross). To better protect immigrants and ensure that they are making well-informed decisions in choosing where to immigrate, more resources and information are vital to prevent potential harm and poor quality of life in their host countries.

Access to knowledge and resources are extremely important for immigrants; according to research, "immigrants have a strong need to feel competent and want to belong when integrating into a new society. But due to dissimilarities in culture, language, and social axioms, immigrants need a lot of information to understand and overcome these differences. The satisfaction of these information needs helps the immigrant to adapt to their new life and society" (Wang et al., 4). Currently, data about immigration is scattered across the web and the information varies depending on each immigrant's country of interest or factors of immigrating. The solution could be to create a single website that shows resources and maps that can assist prospective immigrants in accessing this information easily. This might be a website with information standardized across for all countries in the form of data visualizations, map elements and other information depicters. This can not only help individuals immigrate but also others to form better/more objective opinions on immigration.

The biggest challenge faced by immigrants relates to "language (low English language proficiency, language differences, no information available in languages other than English)" (Wang et al., 4), meaning that it is also more essential that resources are displayed with various language options to be more inclusive of non-English literacy skills. If English options are not available, then resources need to be built with inclusion and accessibility as a priority.

Research has "indicated that the proportion of Asian immigrants using the Internet to obtain information is very high, about 87.5%" (Wang et al., 4), therefore it is increasingly more important that more resources are publicly available online for immigrants to access. There is currently no existing website that includes information in a consolidated manner about resources to help immigrants choose their host country; instead, information is scattered across various governmental and public websites focused on a singular country, rather than a single website featuring information about various countries.

The website includes a dynamic world map visualization that will make  website more accessible. Information about different countries for potential countries to reside in is available. Easy to understand visuals and information to be used by a diverse range of users, and their needs are obtainable on the website. Graphs and charts are displayed with data insights of various data categories on the website. We have displayed information of the top 10-20 countries of immigration (moving in/leaving). More data and visualizations are provided for other countries based on user feedback. A simple and easy-to-use navigation tab is provided for the users. Interactive front-page map visualization is provided for the users, including guidance for use, benefits, and descriptions of key data categories are conveniently available on the website. It is equipped with an FAQ page. It also includes the intake form for contact. Comprehensive data visualizations are provided by different categories.

It includes: 

-Flow of migration by country of origin

-Proportion of immigrants

-Average number of visas granted by -country of origin

-Proportion of religious affiliations

-Most prevalent crime types

-Average cost of academic expenses and tuition

-Average cost of living and expenses etc.

Immigrants need as much information as possible when adapting to a new
country to combat differences in culture and transition smoothly. Without appropriate research, they can face barriers in accessing basic needs and are often subject to exploitation. Immigration Inc. is an interactive website providing knowledge and resources for those interested in moving out of their home countries. Through data visualizations powered by government statistics covering topics such as education, employment, and population, Immigration Inc. enables users to make informed decisions regarding immigration.

Our project idea was originally centered on fighting disinformation concerning immigration. As we did stakeholder research, however, we found that potential users were less interested in finding out about immigration itself than in learning what options they had if they wanted to immigrate. We then switched to our current idea: an interactive map that presents users with the chance to learn more about countries they are interested in immigrating to, and the economic and legal circumstances for immigrants in those countries. 
Our user research indicated that while some users were happy with our product and found it intuitive, others found it clunky and confusing. Some of the data didn't appear to be clearly represented or were misleading (ex: visa application times). Thus, we focused the remainder of our time on making the visuals less confusing and easier to understand by more clearly defining our labels and controls. We took out data that would only confuse the users and focused on creating stories with the data using problem statements in each category. We also decide to rebrand the website with new visual colors and modernize the look based on user feedback.



# Cloning the project 
The project does not have a formal backend structure or a need for a hosting service other than github pages. It is designed to have a compact setup and be easy to relocate and duplicate. 

To create your own copy of the project, please follow the following steps:

1. Fork or clone the repository to another URL on github. 
2. Set up github pages on that new repo. Set up pages so that it deploys from the `docs` folder of whatever branch you will use for development (usually the `main` branch). You can use a custom URL or the one that GitHub provides, but either way you should take note of what URL the site will be deployed to. 
3. Open the package.json file and scroll down to the `build` entry in the `scripts` object. Replace both instances of `immigrationinc.info` with the URL you will deploy to.
4. Open the `src` folder, and open AccessDatabase.js , then replace all of the URLs for each CSV with the raw github links from your new repo. Since your repo has to be public to allow the usage of GitHub Pages anyway, this step can be completed very quickly by using the replace all function in a text editor, to replace all instances of `ramirostUW/ImmigrationMap` with the github user of the new repo's owner, as well as the name of the new repo. 
5. That should be it!

## Testing and deploying the site
First, if you haven't already done so, please install npm to your command line or terminal.
Upon first cloning the repo to your local machine, run `npm install` to get all of the necessary dependencies. Please note that this will take above a gigabyte of free space on your machine.
To test the website, simply run `npm start` on your local machine and open your browser. The website can be found under `http://localhost:1234/`. 

To deploy the website, first make sure that the URL in `package.json` matches the URL that you are trying to publish to. Then, run`npm start` after making all your changes, then run `npm run build`. Afterwards, simply save your changes and then commit & push.
